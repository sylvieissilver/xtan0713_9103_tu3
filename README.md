# Quiz 8

Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

After a group discussion, we decided to choose the artwork from Mondrian to work with it. Looking at this artwork, the first picture in my head is to make these bigger rectangles move like elevators, from left to right, from up to down, or vice versa. Therefore, first of all, I would like to learn from this example to make the rectangles(those bigger patterns) on the artwork move automatically.

After that, from my understanding, we get familiar with Mondrian’s pallet not only because of his red, blue, and yellow but also his black as well. In correspondence with this, the oscillating and render-drawing black ‘frames’ will add an interactive aspect to the work.

Part2:Coding Technique Exploration

For the ‘elevator effects’, I am going to apply translate() function to let them move, combing with foundation as class, fuction and for loop to achieve the purpose of multiple color blocks moving simultaneously and interestingly.

In terms of the interactive liner, the basic one it’s motion linear, however, I am going to explore split() to create boundaries between lines, float() to identify the angles, and void operator to add keypress to create such interaction. In addition, adding class foundation to manage the continuously running lines.
